{
"Timestamp":"10:45","Text":"looping like we're really gonna try to"
},
{
"Timestamp":"10:46","Text":"build something cool you know that was"
},
{
"Timestamp":"10:48","Text":"just a super-fast you know thing just to"
},
{
"Timestamp":"10:50","Text":"show you but I'll experiment with"
},
{
"Timestamp":"10:53","Text":"different sounds along the way right so"
},
{
"Timestamp":"10:55","Text":"like start with you know whatever the"
},
{
"Timestamp":"10:57","Text":"bass sound is whatever the first thing"
},
{
"Timestamp":"10:59","Text":"I'll put on and then I can you know all"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:01","Text":"my pedals down here are all pre looper"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:03","Text":"so I can color the sound the beach"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:05","Text":"tracks you know as it goes down right so"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:08","Text":"you can I think the key to looping is to"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:13","Text":"vary the sounds a bit so they don't get"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:16","Text":"all muddied up with each other right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:17","Text":"yeah that's why I put a base on or"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:19","Text":"whatever or try to get some rope bassy"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:21","Text":"sounds along with some brighter sounds"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:23","Text":"so it's all clear because that's just"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:24","Text":"the general rule of recording I mean you"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:27","Text":"want to color the whole sonic spectrum"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:30","Text":"with a record you want to have good you"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:31","Text":"know round low end you got to have cool"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:35","Text":"mid-range stuff and you got to have the"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:36","Text":"high sprinkly stuff you know to create"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:39","Text":"the full sonic picture to make a great"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:41","Text":"record all great records do that but"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:45","Text":"yeah I think that's about it I think"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:51","Text":"that's a good little demonstration of"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:53","Text":"the looper pedal I mean there's millions"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:54","Text":"of looper pedals out there you could get"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:56","Text":"they're all great you just got to figure"
},
{
"Timestamp":"11:58","Text":"out how to use each one because they all"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:00","Text":"have their own little idiosyncratic"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:02","Text":"things you know I used the line 6 m9 for"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:05","Text":"a while because it was the only thing I"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:06","Text":"had here but the problem with that one"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:08","Text":"is that it's got a very limited amount"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:11","Text":"of time you can record this boss rc1 you"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:14","Text":"can record forever you can make like a"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:16","Text":"three-minute song or something on that"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:17","Text":"thing if you wanted which is nice and"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:20","Text":"that's what I do now I don't even bother"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:21","Text":"looping anymore I'll just do a whole"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:23","Text":"song run the thing you know so there you"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:26","Text":"go alright get you an omni chord and get"
},
{
"Timestamp":"12:29","Text":"to practicing I'll see you guys soon ok"
