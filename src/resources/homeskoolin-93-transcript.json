},
{
"Timestamp":"01:08","Text":"for some reason i was thinking about"
},
{
"Timestamp":"01:09","Text":"that this morning i was laying in bed"
},

{
"Timestamp":"01:48","Text":"key"
},
{
"Timestamp":"01:50","Text":"i mean besides rolling rock"
},
{
"Timestamp":"01:54","Text":"but look man here's how i think of"
},
{
"Timestamp":"01:55","Text":"things um"
},
{
"Timestamp":"01:57","Text":"cowboy chords i know that seems a bit uh"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:00","Text":"silly but think about it okay so like"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:03","Text":"there's"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:05","Text":"there's three major kind"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:09","Text":"of of big old cowboy chord major chords"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:14","Text":"i i know there's more but think about it"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:16","Text":"this way right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:18","Text":"there's that shape"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:21","Text":"there's that shape and there's that"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:24","Text":"shape right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:25","Text":"[Music]"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:27","Text":"the e the a and the d i know that i"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:29","Text":"realize there's more major chords"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:30","Text":"in the cowboy position but"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:33","Text":"these are the ones that you can invert"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:36","Text":"up the fretboard right so let's just"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:38","Text":"take groups of three strings like let's"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:40","Text":"say the top three strings and let's talk"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:42","Text":"about e major"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:43","Text":"right you got the cowboy chord down here"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:45","Text":"right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:47","Text":"this shape"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:50","Text":"and then you've got the next inversion"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:52","Text":"up"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:54","Text":"is the fourth fret but that's just a d"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:56","Text":"chord right and you've got the next"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:57","Text":"inversion up"
},
{
"Timestamp":"02:58","Text":"[Music]"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:00","Text":"but what's that it's just an a chord"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:03","Text":"up you know seven frets and then it"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:06","Text":"repeats"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:08","Text":"so if you think about inverting on three"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:11","Text":"string groups"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:13","Text":"[Music]"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:17","Text":"sorry my wife's throwing boxes on here"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:20","Text":"[Music]"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:21","Text":"okay that that that does that doesn't"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:23","Text":"just apply to the top strings it applies"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:25","Text":"to to all"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:25","Text":"all groups of strings so if you got"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:27","Text":"let's just say the d"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:29","Text":"g and the b"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:32","Text":"[Music]"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:39","Text":"here's the top string"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:42","Text":"now let's go down to a d in the g"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:50","Text":"you see"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:51","Text":"[Music]"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:56","Text":"and also you can go down to the base"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:57","Text":"strings i think about"
},
{
"Timestamp":"03:59","Text":"for some reason i think of the bass"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:00","Text":"strings differently i don't use those"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:02","Text":"same"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:03","Text":"groups of voicings down here but there's"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:05","Text":"millions of ways to invert these"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:07","Text":"there's this there's this"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:11","Text":"there's this there's this there's this"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:14","Text":"[Music]"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:16","Text":"there's this there's this"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:20","Text":"there's this so the i i don't think of"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:23","Text":"the"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:23","Text":"three bass strings the same way i think"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:25","Text":"of the other group so"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:28","Text":"[Music]"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:34","Text":"okay now this is just e major right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:37","Text":"you can do this for every chord let's go"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:39","Text":"to d right i'm gonna give you"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:41","Text":"give you a minute with your guitar i"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:43","Text":"feel like i'm doing one of those kids"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:44","Text":"shows where"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:45","Text":"you let the kid figure it out for a"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:46","Text":"second i'll give you a minute"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:49","Text":"start with this d chord on the top three"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:52","Text":"strings"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:53","Text":"and then figure out how to invert it all"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:56","Text":"the way up"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:56","Text":"the fretboard i'll give you a second to"
},
{
"Timestamp":"04:58","Text":"think about that while i'm"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:03","Text":"testing out my new rolling rod okay you"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:05","Text":"got it"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:06","Text":"so here it is the d shape the a"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:10","Text":"shape the e shape and then and then it"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:13","Text":"starts over"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:16","Text":"you know to a serious guitar player this"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:18","Text":"is pretty basic"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:19","Text":"but it's amazing to me how many people"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:22","Text":"don't get this concept"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:24","Text":"they don't know it i mean i try to show"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:26","Text":"people licks all the time they're like"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:27","Text":"they're"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:28","Text":"fumbling around like they have no idea"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:29","Text":"where these things are on the fretboard"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:31","Text":"so i know"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:34","Text":"i can i can equate it to like chess in"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:37","Text":"the sense that"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:38","Text":"i don't know my my number squares like"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:41","Text":"you know"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:42","Text":"if you said rook to a5 i don't know that"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:44","Text":"by memory i'd have to i'd have to think"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:46","Text":"about that"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:46","Text":"so like memorizing the chessboard grid"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:49","Text":"is the same as memorizing the guitar"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:51","Text":"grid right so now the reason i say"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:54","Text":"there's only three cowboy chord shapes"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:56","Text":"that you have to worry about in these"
},
{
"Timestamp":"05:58","Text":"inversions"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:00","Text":"is because like for f for example f"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:03","Text":"f can be a cowboy chord but all an f is"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:06","Text":"is a capo e"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:07","Text":"you know right same shape"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:10","Text":"capoed up one fret and then you got this"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:13","Text":"voicing for the cowboy g"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:15","Text":"right but really what that is"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:20","Text":"is an a and you got"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:24","Text":"i suppose you could consider this shape"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:27","Text":"as one of the inversions"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:29","Text":"i use it all the time but i don't think"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:31","Text":"of it as one of the three major"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:32","Text":"inversions you know"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:35","Text":"you put it there"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:40","Text":"now let's let's take another let's take"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:42","Text":"another key let's do f"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:43","Text":"right top three strings invert that up"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:47","Text":"all three"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:48","Text":"all through all four inversions right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:51","Text":"what's next"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:52","Text":"d a"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:56","Text":"and when i say a i mean the a shape it's"
},
{
"Timestamp":"06:58","Text":"obvious still an f chord right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:00","Text":"okay this works for minor chords f minor"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:04","Text":"right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:07","Text":"it works for major sevens d major seven"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:12","Text":"right which is similar to an f minor"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:14","Text":"sharp minor"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:16","Text":"so and now when i when i start it gets"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:19","Text":"trickier when you start getting in the"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:20","Text":"middle strings you know"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:22","Text":"like especially when you got when you"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:23","Text":"start getting down to a d and g"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:25","Text":"that group here's your e"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:30","Text":"which is just the bottom of this chord"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:31","Text":"the benal chord you know they always"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:33","Text":"played their major chords like this"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:35","Text":"and you got which is just the bottom of"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:38","Text":"the hendrix"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:39","Text":"voicing"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:41","Text":"[Music]"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:42","Text":"then this right so these"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:47","Text":"you just got to know these"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:49","Text":"instantaneously you cannot"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:51","Text":"around you have to know these"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:53","Text":"within your sleep you know"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:56","Text":"in all keys right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"07:59","Text":"you have to know them and when you know"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:01","Text":"them all"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:03","Text":"then it can unlock all these little two"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:06","Text":"and three note shapes that you can use"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:07","Text":"in your soloing right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:10","Text":"i don't know if this i don't even know"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:11","Text":"what the cage system is maybe that's"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:12","Text":"what"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:13","Text":"they talk about in the cage system i"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:14","Text":"don't i don't know i don't i don't know"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:16","Text":"what"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:16","Text":"any of the systems are so forgive me if"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:18","Text":"i'm having this stroke of genius with"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:20","Text":"somebody else's idea but this is just"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:22","Text":"how i think of it okay"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:26","Text":"and like man um"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:29","Text":"inverting these chords all over the"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:31","Text":"place i mean"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:33","Text":"you take a three a three note chord"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:36","Text":"recipe and there's a million places you"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:38","Text":"could play it right let's just talk"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:39","Text":"about the key of e major let's say"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:41","Text":"you got the root the third and the fifth"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:43","Text":"e g sharp"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:44","Text":"and b right there's so many places you"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:47","Text":"could grab"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:47","Text":"those three notes you know"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:51","Text":"there's a million places you could be"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:53","Text":"like you'd be like"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:57","Text":"you could be like uh like this you could"
},
{
"Timestamp":"08:58","Text":"be like"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:00","Text":"there's endless places anytime you can"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:04","Text":"grab those three notes together that's"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:05","Text":"an e major chord and that works for any"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:07","Text":"chord recipe right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:08","Text":"that's what i'm always talking about"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:09","Text":"when i say jumbling up the"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:11","Text":"normal patterns and chords"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:22","Text":"[Music]"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:34","Text":"okay"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:37","Text":"there's no time to even think about that"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:40","Text":"you just got to know"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:41","Text":"that's e"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:42","Text":"[Music]"

{
"Timestamp":"09:45","Text":"these are all e's right"
},
{
"Timestamp":"09:50","Text":"you just got to know it all the possible"
